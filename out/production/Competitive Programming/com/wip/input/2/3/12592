born down in a dead mans town
the first kick i took was when i hit the ground
you end up like a dog thats been beat too much
till you spend half your life just covering up
born in the usa
i was born in the usa
i was born in the usa
born in the usa
bot in a little hometown jam
so they put a rifle in my hand
sent me off to a foreign land
to go and kill the yellow man
come back home to the refinery
hiring man says son if it was up to me
went down to see my va man
he said son dont you understand now
had a brother at khe sahn
fighting off the viet cong
theyre still there hes all gone
he had a woman he loved in saigon
i got a picture of him in her arms now
down in the shadow of the penitentiary
out by the gas fires of the refinery
im ten years burning down the road
now here to run aint got nowhere to go
Im a long gone daddy in the usa
